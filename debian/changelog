libsocket6-perl (0.23+ds-0+nmu1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Switch to upstream tarball, using “ds” for “debian source” as a
    suffix since dak wouldn't appreciate different tarballs having
    the same name.
  * Add watch file.
  * Drop dbs from build-depends, and kill some dbs bits in debian/rules,
    adjusting clean accordingly (closes: #576062).

  [ Robert Luberda ]
  * Prepare this NMU based on Cyril's version from #576062 in order to
    get rid of dbs build-dependency. Upload it to DELAYED/10.
  * Switch to the 3.0 (quilt) source format.
  * Switch to debhelper v9 and its tiny rules format.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4.
